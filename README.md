a link to an article or web site you find interesting related to software development/engineering: https://novoda.com/blog/2023/09/26/how-to-ensure-exceptional-software-quality-on-mobile/

Reason I found out this article is interesting is that it completely explain how to ensure exceptional software quality on mobile, as mobile has been crucial part of our life. The components passage give is 1：Unit, Integration & UI: The Pyramid of Testing in Mobile； 2： Performance & Stability Metrics to Determine Software Quality； 3：scalability and maintainability. In context of Pyramid of Testing, from bottom to up signify the costs and complexities of implementation going up. So we need to test thoroughly at the unit test level and make it less effort for integration tests and UI tests. In speaking of Performance & Stability Metrics to Determine Software Quality, keys are: Crash rate(maintaining a low crash rate); Startup time(too long will make users bounce off before interacting with it); Time to interaction; User reviews; Change Failure Rate; Battery usage and DAta Storage. Scalability comes with Planning for Increased API calls; Reducing Tech Debt and Maintaining legacy versions. In other words, we need to ensure the systems and processes can handle the accession of back end from clients. To sum up, I think this is a really well passage to get started in software development.
